Clipper migration to Linux Repository.

Clipper was a DOS oriented dBase compiler in the 80's. Was developed by Nantucket, 
and was his flagship during almost 15 years. Later Computer Associates 
buyed Clipper, and it continued its migration towards a new operating 
system (and new paradigma), but it did suceed.

With a big code base moving around some found there was no good replacement to
this excelent compiler. So migration is being made towards moving it to open source.

Good Efforts are xClip, Harbour and other projects. But believe it or not, Win 
implementations are taking the lead and Linux ones are being left behind.

My intention is to make a Jump, to Linux again, of all those new efforts 
and developments. And provide a trully cross-plataform for end-users.
